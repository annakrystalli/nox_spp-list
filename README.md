# ACTION PLAN

## 1. BUILD DATABASE AND HOST ONLINE
  - Hosted, updated and supported for the duration of the project.
## 2. DEVELOP SOFTWARE TO FACILITATE EASY ACCESS TO DATA
  - build around user needs to facilitate easy querying.
  - R package for accessing and manipulating the data 
## 3. DEVELOP ARCHIVE VERSION
  Once the project ends, there will be no funds to maintain a live instance of the database.
   - To ensure long-term sustainability, we will archive the data in a permanent repository such as Zenodo or Orda
   - Software will be developed that will allow automatic construction of a live database for others to host, either locally or online
## 4. DEVELOP DOCUMENTATION
  - Version controlled fully documented record of development
  - Documentation on access and use of live database
  - Documentation on access and use of archived database
