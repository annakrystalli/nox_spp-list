NERC grant application fro project: 
### **Assessing the efficacy and costs of noxious species lists, a common policy tool in invasive species management.**

## RSE proposal:

Planned as a collaboration betweeen RSE and the Library. The plan is to support the project from the beginning with research data management and guide the collation of the various datasets to enable final compilation into a usable data product. This data product will consist of a database which will be live and queryable for the duration of the project. In addition a light software wrapper will be designed and developed to facilitate easy and efficient querying of the database for researchers without a need for database querying languages. Finally, at the end of the project, the database and the full functionality developed around it will be packaged for archival and local use. 

This field is generally a fast evolving ecosystem, both in terms of power of avaialable technologies, the capabilities and availability of archiving infrastrucuture and open data requirements. So the technologies used will be the most up to date and may not refelect current apporaches. The project itself will involve some experimentation and so the 6 months proposed & costed pertain to a certain level of innovation, not simply a standard out of the box service. So in addition to the database, we envisage our involvement will also push forward in the field of making data product FAIR.

**Estimated time: 6 months**

**Estimated cost:**

# ACTION PLAN

## 1. BUILD DATABASE AND HOST ONLINE
  - Hosted, updated and supported for the duration of the project.
## 2. DEVELOP SOFTWARE TO FACILITATE EASY ACCESS TO DATA
  - build around user needs to facilitate easy querying.
  - R package for accessing and manipulating the data 
## 3. DEVELOP ARCHIVE VERSION
  Once the project ends, there will be no funds to maintain a live instance of the database.
   - To ensure long-term sustainability, we will archive the data in a permanent repository such as Zenodo or Orda
   - Software will be developed that will allow automatic construction of a live database for others to host, either locally or online
## 4. DEVELOP DOCUMENTATION
  - Version controlled fully documented record of development
  - Documentation on access and use of live database
  - Documentation on access and use of archived database
