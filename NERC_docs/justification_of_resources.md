This is easy enough to do. Basically a statement of the day rate and brief overview of what this buys + a pointer to docs with the detail. Big up the RSE team too.

**Estimated duration:** 6 months spread over the duration of the project

**Estimated cost:** Approx £36,000 (based on a daily rate of £274)

Our day rate of £274 per day is mostly the salary of a Grade 7.x Research Software Engineer but also includes some admin and management oversight time.

RSE Sheffield is one of the leading RSE groups in the UK with 8 members of full time staff. Co-founded by 2 EPSRC-funded RSE fellows, Mike Croucher and Paul Richmond. The 2015 RSE fellowship call was the first of its kind https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/calls/rsefellowships/. The group is deeply embedded in the national RSE community and has close ties with The Software Sustainability Institute, https://www.software.ac.uk, and the UK Research Software Engineering Association http://rse.ac.uk/. This project aligns with the aims of the PIs fellowship project ‘Building capability and support in research software’ http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/N018958/1
