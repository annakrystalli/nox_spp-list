Impact Plan

This needs to be precisely set out what we'll do and when it will happen, along with who it benefits, without getting into the technical 'how' (we just point to the DMP)

## Research Software Engineering (RSE) proposal:

Good data management techniques are a fundamental component of good scientific practice. In this project, a large number of diverse data sources are required to be combined and interogated. The ideal way to manage access to such a complex stucture is through a database. This approach will preserve the data linkage and interoperability developed during the project and retain smooth and easy access to this complex data product.

Planned as a collaboration betweeen RSE and the Library. The plan is to support research data management from the beginning of the project to guide the collation of the various datasets and enable efficient final compilation into a usable data product. The final data product will consist of a versioned database with a DOI, which will be live and queryable for the duration of the project. In addition a light software wrapper with it's own DOI will be designed and developed to facilitate easy and efficient querying of the database without the need for knowledge of specialised database query languages. Finally, at the end of the project, the database and software will be packaged for archival in a manner which preserves the full developed functionality. Documentation will be developed to enable anyone with the requisite compute resources to recreate the live service.

This field is generally a fast evolving ecosystem, both in terms of power, accesibility and usability of new technologies, the capabilities and availability of archiving infrastrucuture and open data requirements. As such, the technologies used will be the most up to date and may not reflect current apporaches, ***include potentially some propsed here***. The project itself will involve some experimentation, so the 6 months proposed & costed pertain to a certain level of innovation, not simply a standard out of the box service. In this respect, we envisage our involvement will push forward in the field of making a research data product [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples). We will happily work with specialists at the appropriate NERC Data Centre **TO MAKE THIS SOME SORT OF CASE STUDY**.

Going to this effort of RDM support **preserves** the quality, integrity, transparency and openness of the research the data will support. It will also ensure the continuing availability of the fruits of this important work. An emphasis on accessibility tools in a variety of ways will allow for multiple and diverse downstream use cases for a variety of stakeholders, including research, teaching, and wider exploitation for the public good, by individuals, government, business and other organisations. This enables the maximum value to be gained from the investment of public funds made in their compilation and provides the widest possible opportunities for re-use of these data.
